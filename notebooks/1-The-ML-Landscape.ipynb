    "## Types of ML Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised/Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "- In supervised learning, the training data include the labels of the desired variable. Ex: kNN, linear regression, SVMs, DT and RF, etc.\n",
    "- In unsupervised learning, the training data is unlabeled. There are some types: Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical cluster analysis), Anomaly detection and novelty detection (One-class SVM, Isolation Forest), Visualization and Dimensionality reduction (PCA, Kernel PCA) or Association rule learning (Apriori, Eclat).\n",
    "- In semisupervised learning, not all the data is labelled, so it must combine both unsupervised and supervised learning.\n",
    "- In reinforcement learning, the learning system, called agent, can observe the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch and Online learning\n",
    "- In batch learning, the system is incapable to learn incrementally. It must be trained with all the available data and, if after there is new data, it should be retrained again.\n",
    "- In online learning, the system is trained incrementally by feeding it with bunches of data, called mini-batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance-Based vs Model-Based Learning\n",
    "It distinguish how both models generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In instance-based learning, the system learns by heart and then it generalizes to new instances depending on their similarity with known examples.\n",
    "- In model-based learning, a model is built to make predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Challenges of ML\n",
    "\n",
    "- Insufficient Quantity of Training Data\n",
    "- Nonrepresentative Training data\n",
    "- Poor-Quality data\n",
    "- Irrelevant features\n",
    "- Overfitting the training data\n",
    "- Underfitting the training data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing and validating\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning and model selection\n",
    "- Data mismatch (the validation and test sets must be as representative as possible of the data you expect to use in the future)\n"
